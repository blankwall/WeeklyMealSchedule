Iam a fit 34 year old father of 3, I enjoy high protein meals, kid friendly is necessary. Really only vegetarian or fish on Friday meat every other day. Can you help me plan dinner for the week. We are a family of 5 and need kid friendly options. We eat vegetarian or fish on Fridays.  Only do fish/shrimp On Fridays. Start the meal for tomorrow, monday. Ensure each meal has a protein option even if on the side.
